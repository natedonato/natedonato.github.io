I'm Nate Donato.  I live in Oakland CA and root for the Athletics.  I'm bad at picking favorites, but my favorite color has traditionally been green.  I like coffee, dumplings, bonsai trees, and rainy days.  

Professionally I've been a Software Engineer / Web Developer for the last 4+ years.  Currently I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Mojave](https://mojave.agency) where I've worked on web properties for [Turnitin](https://turnitin.com), [Ueno](https://ueno.co/), [Engine 1](https://engine1.com/), [Guideline](https://www.guideline.com/), and more.  I started in 2019 as a developer for [Alpaca.markets](Alpaca.markets).  You can see more about my development experience on my [CV](https://natedonato.com/cv) page.

Prior to dev work, I did stints as a subsitute teacher (K-12), an SAT test prep tutor, and a grocery clerk at the [best grocery store ever](https://www.instagram.com/stargrocerberkeley/).  I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a BA in Literature, which makes me a Banana Slug.

Outside of work I'm always up to different stuff like making [games](https://natedonato.com/games) and [generative artwork](https://natedonato.com/generative) for fun, writing [zines](https://natedonato.com/zines), drawing animated gifs, taking photos on my film cameras, studying Japanese, playing [Chess](https://lichess.org/@/naet) or [Go](https://online-go.com/player/787153/), making music, enjoying rainy days, reading the Sunday newspaper, or spending time with my family.  I'm a new father of a wonderful baby boy named after my late grandfather.
